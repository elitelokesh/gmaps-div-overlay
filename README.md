DivOverlay is a very simple container for HTML to be shown over a Google Map at any position. All it does is calculate margins from the map bounds so its entire contents are within the map. Take a look at [the demo](http://jonyt.github.com/gmaps-div-overlay/).
The constructor takes 3 arguments: the HTML container, the map to attach to and the position of the overlay.
DivOverlay has only two functions: show() and hide(). Should be self-explanatory.
